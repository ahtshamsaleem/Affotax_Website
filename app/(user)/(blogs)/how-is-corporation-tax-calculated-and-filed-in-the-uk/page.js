						<h3>Determine taxable profits</h3>

						<p>
							The first step in calculating corporation tax is to
							determine your taxable profits. To do this, subtract
							allowable business expenses from your total income.
							Allowable business expenses include operating costs,
							staff salaries, and other business-related expenses.
						</p>

						<h3>Determine taxable profits</h3>
						<p>
							The first step in calculating corporation tax is to
							determine your taxable profits. To do this, subtract
							allowable business expenses from your total income.
							Allowable business expenses include operating costs,
							staff salaries, and other business-related expenses.
						</p>

						<h3>Apply the corporation tax rate</h3>
						<p>
							Once you have successfully determined your taxable
							profits, the next thing you should do is apply the
							corporation tax rate. The corporation tax rates have
							been revised for the UK's financial year as of 1
							April 2023. <br />
							If your company has a profit of over GBP 250,000,
							you will have to pay 25% corporation tax; if it
							falls below GBP 50,000, you will pay 19%. However,
							your corporation tax can vary if your profits fall
							between GBP 50,000 and GBP 250,000; you must pay the
							primary tax rate (25%) with some marginal relief.
						</p>

						<h3>Deduct any tax credits</h3>
						<p>
							Suppose your company is eligible for tax credits,
							which is the money you can subtract from the income
							taxes you owe. In that case, you can deduct them
							from your corporation tax bill.
						</p>

						<h3>Submit your corporation tax return</h3>
						<p>
							After following the above steps, you are ready to
							submit your corporation tax return to Her Majesty
							Revenue & Customs (HMRC) within 12 months of the end
							of your accounting period.
						</p>

						<h3>Factor in special rules</h3>
						<p>
							Special rules or exemptions can affect Your
							corporation tax calculation due to particular
							circumstances. These circumstances include capital
							allowances on fixed assets, etc., which help reduce
							the corporation tax or research and development
							(R&D) tax credits, which are companies that work on
							projects in science and technology. <br />
							This incentive helps a company offset some of the
							costs of eligible research and development (R&D). It
							is essential to note these factors that can be
							beneficial for you.
						</p>

						<p>
							Suppose you have purchased any asset, including a
							computer, plant, machinery, or other office
							equipment. In that case, you can claim back the
							amount on the corporation tax. Contact us and let us
							help you reclaim your purchasing amount.
