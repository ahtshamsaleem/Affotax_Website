							If you have a UK-based enterprise then you must be

						<p>
							{" "}

							exploring the process of filing dormant company
							accounts. Before we rain on your parade, let's get
							the ball rolling!.

						<h2>What are dormant accounts?</h2>
						<p>
							They are bank, business, or company accounts that
							have had no significant financial
							transactions/financial activity over a specific time
							period.
						</p>
						<p>
							{" "}
							According to the UK government, a corporation is
							considered dormant if it has ceased trading, because
							companies are required to file dormant accounts with
							Companies House, if:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								No noteworthy transactions happened in the
								fiscal year.
							</li>
							<li>
								Throughout the fiscal year, the firm did not
								operate.
							</li>
							<li>The enterprise is not an exempted company.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Why does an account become dormant?</h2>
						<p>
							It happens for several reasons, the common of which
							is: The business temporarily ceases/halts its
							operations. <br />
							This could be perhaps because of restructuring,
							seasonal fluctuations, or changes in market
							conditions; in which case the account remains open,
							but there are less or insignificant financial
							activities.
						</p>

						<h3>File dormant company accounts</h3>
						<p>
							If you feel like you meet the criteria for filing,
							you will have to prepare and file them with
							Companies House either online or by post.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the latter case, it can take a lot of your time.
							You can do it online through a reliable and
							affordable accountancy firm that provides Dormant
							Accounts services. Here is what you will include:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Company name and registration number</li>
							<li>Statement of financial position</li>
							<li>Notes to the accounts</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							Keep in mind, it still needs to comply with
							accounting standards, like the Companies Act 2006.
						</p>
						<p>
							Below is an example of a inactive account's balance
							sheet structure:
						</p>
						<h3>Balance Sheet | 30 April 2022</h3>

						<table>
							<thead>
								<tr>
									<th>Data</th>

									<th> £</th>
								</tr>
							</thead>

							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<th>
										Share capital called up but not paid
									</th>

									<th>1</th>
								</tr>

								<tr>
									<th>Net Assets</th>

									<th>1</th>
								</tr>

								<tr>
									<th>Issued share capital</th>

									<th>1</th>
								</tr>

								<tr>
									<th>Ordinary share of £</th>

									<th>1 Each</th>
								</tr>

								<tr>
									<th>Total Shareholder Funds</th>

									<th>1 </th>
								</tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>

						<h2>Dormant company accounts filing requirements</h2>
						<p>
							According to Companies House, your firm is required
							to file within 9 months of the end of the fiscal
							year. It is important to file on time because if you
							fail to do so, it can result in fines and penalties
							to be paid to Companies House.
							<br />
							Here is what you need to keep in mind:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Determine dormancy </strong> <br /> It
								is important to check whether you qualify for it
								or not{" "}
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Prepare financial statements </strong>{" "}
								<br />
								It is a requirement to prepare a financial
								statement; include a balance sheet, notes, and a
								director's report.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Complete the CT600 form </strong> <br />
								It was not a requirement before but now it is
								important to complete the CT600 form which is
								used to report taxable profits or losses. It is
								compulsory to complete and submit the CT600 form
								to HMRC.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Submit to companies house </strong>{" "}
								<br />
								Once your financial statements and CT600 form
								are ready, submit them to Companies House.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>
							How do dormant accounts affect your UK-based
							company?
						</h2>

						<p>
							It can have various impacts, which can be both
							positive and negative:
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Positive:</strong> It can help you in
							keeping your business's legal standing and avoiding
							fines or penalties for non-compliance.{" "}
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Negative:</strong> Closing dormant accounts
							can harm your credit standing and increase the
							difficulty of getting credit or funding later on.
							Additionally, it could be more challenging to draw
							in partners or investors who would interpret them as
							an indication of unstable finances.
						</p>
						<p>
							For businesses or companies in the UK, understanding
							and filing is very important, because it helps in
							maintaining transparency, compliance with legal
							obligations, etc. Being up-to-date can help you
							transform your company’s financial standing when it
							resumes its trading or overall operations.
