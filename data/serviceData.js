Note: Paye for employees must be paid immediately and punctually to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). If you want to pay monthly, your payment will be due on the 22nd of the following tax month. For quarterly payments, it is due on the 22nd after the end of the quarter. For example, if the quarter ends on July 5th, then the payment is expected on July 22nd.

It is called the 'Accounting Period' between your submissions. You are required to make advance payments, either monthly or quarterly, towards your bill during your accounting period and the final price upon submitting your VAT return. HMRC mandates this as of April 2022 for VAT-registered businesses to use software compatible with Making Tax Digital for their quarterly VAT return. Your existing online account is no longer suitable to submit, and failing to file using MTD-compatible software may lead to penalties from HMRC.

The expert team at Affotax has mastered the what and how of MTD VAT submission in the UK and is ready to take the burden off your shoulders. Our MTD-compatible software allows you to have the best experience in your digital submission. We promise accurate and timely submissions ‚Äì get a quote today!

	content: `LLP company formation refers to the process of setting up a Limited Liability Partnership, one of the most popular options in today‚Äôs world for businesses to get the benefits of a partnership. When you register, you and your partners protect your private assets; in case your business falls, you will only lose your money invested in the business and not your personal or assets as they stay secure. In an unregistered partnership, each partner may be responsible for others' debts if something turns out wrong. That is why LLP formation offers more security to its partners.

Affotax is the best and most affordable choice available. We understand the complexities of forming an LLP and the importance of the other responsibilities it brings with it. That is why we offer customised LLP formation plans, crafted specifically for you to reach your business goals. We also offer many other benefits ‚Äì check them out and get a quote today!`,
